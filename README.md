# Roll20
These are my personal ROLL20 scripts.

EberronNPCGenerator is my first script.

When completed it will generate an NPC of a specific race (and Nationality or subrace), gender, and background. ALl of these can be randomly selected.

Names are based on Race\Gender.

Random backgrounds are selected from race specific lists.

TODO 

After all of this is completed I am loooking to make the script copy an NPC charactersheet, 
rename the copy, place all of the roleplay notes into the gm notes, and modify the stats for race
